# Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART)
 Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART), a serial communication protocol that can be used to send data between an Arduino board and other devices

 > [!NOTE]
 
 >  It's among the earliest serial protocols and even though it has in many places been replaced by SPI and I2C it's still widely used for lower-speed and lower-throughput applications because it is very simple, low-cost and easy to implement.
