# MQTT-Message Queuing Telemetry Transport   ([MQTT.org](https://mqtt.org/))

MQTT is the most commonly used messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). MQTT stands for MQ Telemetry Transport. The protocol is a set of rules that defines how IoT devices can publish and subscribe to data over the Internet. MQTT is used for messaging and data exchange between IoT and industrial IoT (IIoT) devices, such as embedded devices, sensors, industrial PLCs, etc. 

> [!NOTE]
> - It requires minimal resources since it is lightweight and efficient
  - Supports bi-directional messaging between device and cloud
  - Can scale to millions of connected devices
  - Supports reliable message delivery through 3 QoS levels
  - Works well over unreliable networks
  -  Security enabled, so it works with TLS and common authentication protocols
